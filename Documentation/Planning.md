# APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection - Planning
 
## Working cycle:
1. Read competition information and relevant content to feel comfortable with the problem. Create a hypothesis based on the problem.
2. Initial data exploration to feel comfortable with the problem and the data.
3. Build the first implementation (baseline).
4. Loop through [Analyze -> Approach(model) -> Implement -> Evaluate].

## 1. Literature review (read some kernels and relevant content related to the competition).
